# Kickoff notes (19/04/2022)


# TODO
- [ ] Mirror code to EWI GitLab!  
	(need permission to create a repo -> contact TA)  
	"Preferably" GitLab should be the main platform, not GitHub :(
- [ ] First assignment is due in a few days (21/04/2022)
- [ ] 2nd assignment (CoC) is 28/04
- [ ] Ask TA about testing


# Organization
Project is assessed by client, TU coach, TA, technical writing lecturer, software project coordinator

12 brightspace assignments throughout the project (team analysis, and building up to final report)  
\+ 2 peer reviews  
\+ 2 presentations (midterm and final)

3 integrated modules (part of the assignments that are part of the project):
- technical writing
- teamwork
- responsible computer science

Note: tests are mandatory, and maybe even more important than additional functionality!


# Grading
15% final report  
20% research  
35% product  
20% process  
10% presentation (+Q&A)  
(All parts require a >5.0 to pass, average >5.75)

Midterm process: something something checkmarks halfway through (check slides!)


# Presentations
- Audience: general technical background
- Remind client that they are expected at final presentation?
- (Re-)apply knowledge from oral presentations module
- Everyone has to present in at least one of the presentations
- Everyone is expected to participate in the Q&A

Final presentation:
- Should convince audience that project goal has been achieved
- 20 minutes (incl demo) + 10 minutes Q&A
- In last week of Q4 (we can give up a preference of what day to present)
