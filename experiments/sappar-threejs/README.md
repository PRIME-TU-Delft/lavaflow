### Local Preview and Testing

Due to browser restrictions surrounding use of the camera, you must use HTTPS to view or preview your site, even if doing so locally from your computer. If you're using `webpack`, consider using `webpack-dev-server` which has an `https` option to enable this.

Alternatively you can use the [ZapWorks command-line tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zappar/zapworks-cli) to serve a folder over HTTPS for access on your local computer, like this:

```
zapworks serve .
```

The command also lets you serve the folder for access by other devices on your local network, like this:

```
zapworks serve . --lan
```
