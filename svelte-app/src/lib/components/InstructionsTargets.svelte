		Add targets where you think the lava will flow. You can't place targets too close to 
		the craters or too close to other targets. How close you can place targets to craters
		and other targets depends on the difficulty mode you selected. There is also a minimum
		amount of targets you need to place, which also depends on your difficulty mode. You
		can never place more than 10 targets.

		Points are based on how close the steam turbine is placed to the lava stream, divided by the number of turbines. The points represent how much energy the average steam turbine generates, measured in megawatts.
