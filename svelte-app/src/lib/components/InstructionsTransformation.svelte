	<h2>Instructions</h2>

	<div class="instruction">
		Drag the shapes on your screen to the corresponding shapes on the template. 
		Make sure that you don't leave part of your drawing outside the lines it makes.
	</div>

	<h2>Fixing your scan</h2>
	<div>
		If your scan does not work, you can move the shapes slightly, which could
		fix it. Scanning works best if the draggable shapes are on the inside of the
		rectangle formed by the shapes on the template, rather than outside or on top
		of it. If moving markers does not work, try taking a new picture.</div>
